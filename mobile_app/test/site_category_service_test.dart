/// Covers SiteCategoryService - the three-mechanism orchestrator (exact
/// lookup -> keyword match -> ML fallback) described in its own doc
/// comment. This had no test coverage even though all three of its
/// components are now individually tested
/// (site_category_ml_classifier_test.dart, adult_keyword_detector_test.dart,
/// and the real bundled cleaned_site_categories.csv lookup table) - what
/// hadn't been checked is the ORDER and short-circuiting between them,
/// which is exactly where a real bug could hide even with each mechanism
/// individually correct (e.g. keyword matching running before the exact
/// lookup, or the ML fallback firing even when a cheaper mechanism
/// already found an answer).
///
/// Like the other ML-consumer tests, this loads the REAL bundled assets
/// (declared in pubspec.yaml) rather than mocking anything - no
/// production code changes were needed to make this testable.
///
/// IMPORTANT ABOUT THE TEST DOMAINS BELOW: cleaned_site_categories.csv
/// (58,249 rows) is essentially the same raw domain lists the ML model
/// was trained on, so almost any real-world gambling/adult domain you'd
/// reach for is ALSO a literal exact-match row - which would only ever
/// exercise the lookup path, not keyword matching or the ML fallback.
/// Every domain used to test the keyword and ML paths below was verified
/// (grep against the real bundled CSV, both directly here and
/// independently via a Python replay of the ML model) to actually be
/// absent from the exact-match dataset, so each test genuinely exercises
/// the mechanism it claims to.
