/**
 * Records the outcome of every restriction enforcement attempt (blocking a
 * restricted app via [WellScreenAccessibilityService]) into
 * `flutter.restriction_log_json`, which child_home_screen.dart's
 * syncUsageReport() pushes to Firestore alongside the SMS/usage logs so the
 * parent dashboard can show a real restriction success/failure rate instead
 * of just assuming the block always works.
 *
 * Mirrors SmsAlertSender's recordOutcome pattern (same rolling-log shape,
 * same MAX_LOG_ENTRIES cap) for consistency across the app's outcome logs.
 *
 * responseTimeMs is the time from the accessibility event that detected the
 * restricted app being opened to the block screen actually being launched -
 * near-instantaneous in practice (it's a local Activity launch, not a
 * network call), but it's a real measurement, not a placeholder, and it's
 * what lets a failed launch (e.g. a SecurityException from a locked-down
 * device) show up as a distinct "failed" outcome instead of being silently
 * swallowed.
