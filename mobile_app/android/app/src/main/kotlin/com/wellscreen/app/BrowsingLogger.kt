/**
 * Records domains captured by [BrowserUrlExtractor] into
 * `flutter.browsing_log_json`, mirroring [RestrictionLogger]'s rolling-log
 * shape/cap so child_home_screen.dart's syncUsageReport() can pick it up
 * the same way it already does for restriction/SMS/sync logs.
 *
 * SCOPE NOTE: this only records *that* a domain was visited and *when* -
 * it does not classify or act on it. Category matching against
 * data_cleaned/site_categories/cleaned_site_categories.csv, and any
 * resulting restriction/alert, is separate, not-yet-built work. This class
 * exists to make URL capture itself independently verifiable (you can see
 * real captured domains in the log) before building anything on top of it.
