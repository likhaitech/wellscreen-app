"""Tests for require_admin() in app/services/admin_auth_service.py - the
gate every /admin/* route sits behind (admin_logs, admin_settings,
admin_users). Covers the branches that decide who gets in: no credentials
at all, a revoked token, a token that plain fails to verify, a valid token
with no admin claim, and the two independent ways a token IS recognized as
admin (`admin: true` vs `role: "admin"`) - both are real code paths
system_log_service-consuming routes rely on.

firebase_admin.auth.verify_id_token and initialize_firebase are mocked -
no real Firebase project is touched, no network call is made.
